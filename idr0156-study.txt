Study Type Term Accession	NCIT_C21051
Study Description	The genome folds into a hierarchy of three-dimensional structures within the nucleus. At the sub-megabase scale, chromosomes form topologically associating domains (TADs). However, how TADs fold in single cells is elusive. Here, we reveal TAD features inaccessible to cell population analysis by using super-resolution microscopy. TAD structures and physical insulation associated with their borders are variable between individual cells,  yet chromatin intermingling is enriched within TADs compared to adjacent TADs in most cells. The spatial segregation of TADs is further exacerbated during cell differentiation.  Favored interactions within TADs are regulated by cohesin and CTCF through distinct mechanisms:  cohesin generates chromatin contacts and intermingling while CTCF prevents inter-TAD contacts.  Furthermore, TADs are subdivided into discrete nanodomains, which persist in cells depleted of CTCF or cohesin,  whereas disruption of nucleosome contacts alters their structural organization. Altogether, these results provide a physical basis for the folding of individual chromosomes at the nanoscale.

Experiment Description	Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were cultured in the conditions described below (see Protocol Description) and they were fixed on coverslips prior to the Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (DNA FISH) procedure. A large set of Oligopaint probes covering Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) of various size and various epigenetic signatures were used for the DNA FISH. Coverslips with hybridized cells were then observed with Structured Illumination Microscopy (3D-SIM). This approach allows for the description of TAD organization in mouse ESCs (Overlap Fractions (OFs) and 3D distances with consecutive Oligopaint probes within TADs or between TADs, see the article) and the identification of TAD sub-structures, dubbed Chromatin NanoDomains (CNDs), by applying watershed-segmentation on the Oligopaint probe fluorescent signal. Assays TSA and TSA-CTL (control) were performed in parallel with and without trichostatin-A (TSA), respectively. TSA is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylases that induces histone hyperacetylation.

Experiment Comments	3D-SIM.  A total of 26 Oligopaint probes (11, 12, 21, 22, 32, 33, 51, 51a, 51b, 52, 61a, 61b, 62, 81, 82a, 82b, 101, 102a, 102b, 103, 111, 112, 121a, 121b, 141a, 141b) were monitored in the ESC assay. Most of the probes were monitored by pair to measure their intermingling (consecutive probes within a given TAD) or to measure their partitioning along the genome (consecutive probes of two adjacent TADs, separated by a TAD border). Refer to Extented Data Fig.1 of the article to visualize the probes on specific Hi-C maps. For example, in ESC, probes 11 and 12 or 51a and 51b are two consecutive probes belonging to the same TAD, probes 32 and 33 or 51 and 52 are two consecutive probes belonging to two consecutive TADs, therefore separated by a TAD border. ESC_TSA and ESC_TSA-CTL assays were performed using 11 Oligopaint probes (32, 62, 81, 101, 102a, 102b, 103, 111, 112, 121a, 121b).

Quality Control Description	Mouse standard E14 cell line (E14Tg2a.4) were purchased directly from MMRRC, UC Davis, and were not re-authenticated besides the presence of the Oct4 ESC marker (monitored by RTqPCR and immuno-labeling using an anti-Oct4 antibody (catalog no. 5677S; Cell signaling)). The successful hybridization of oligopaints recognizing mouse-specific sequences to the genome is another quality control for the nature of the cells.

Protocol Description	Mouse ESCs (E14Tg2a.4 cell line, MMRRC, UC Davis) were cultured on 0.1% gelatin-coated (catalog no.G1890-100G; Sigma-Aldrich) dishes in Glasgow's MEM (catalog no. 21710025; Gibco), supplemented with 15% FCS qualified serum (catalog no. 26140079, US origin; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1x GlutaMAX (catalog no. 35050038; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1x MEM non-essential amino acids solution (catalog no.11140035; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 50 U penicillin-streptomycin (catalog no.15140122; Gibco), 0.1 mM sodium pyruvate (catalog no. 11360070; Gibco), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (catalog no. 31350010; Gibco) and 1,000 U ml-1 recombinant mouse LIF protein (catalog no. ESG1107; Sigma-Aldrich). The medium was changed every day and cells were passaged every 2 days using the TrypLE express enzyme (catalog no. 12604013; Gibco). Two days before the FISH, approximately 150.000 cells were plated in a 6-well plate containing an autoclaved glass coverslip (170 ± 5 μm (ZEISS)) coated with 0.1% gelatin, with fresh medium replacement after one day. Mouse ESCs were grown on the coverslip for a total of 2 days and washed once with PBS before fixation prior to the FISH procedure. For TSA treatment, the day of the collection, medium was replaced with fresh medium containing TSA (final concentration at 100 ng/ml) (catalog no. T-8552; Sigma-Aldrich) for 6h before collecting cells for the FISH procedure.	Standard growth conditions. If no specific treatment, use as the control condition. TSA treatment for 6h (see details of the protocol on the left column).	Cells were hybridized with the Oligopaint fluorescent probes using a DNA FISH protocol, which is briefly described in the article and a detailed protocol can be found in Szabo et al. (PMID: 32820407; DOI: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0664-3_13). Here, pairs of Oligopaint probes labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 and ATTO 565 fluorophores were used for OFs and 3D distance measurements, only Oligopaint probes labeled with ATTO 565 were used to count the number of  CNDs inside TADs. The number of oligos per Oligopaint probe depends on its genomic size and the density of oligos found in that region. The coordinates, the size and the number of oligos for each Oligopaint probe can be found in the Extended Data Fig.9 of the article. Each oligo carryies 3 fluorophores allowing a robust fluorescent signal of each Oligopaint probe. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Coverslips containing cells were mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD and sealed with nail polish. 3D-SIM imaging was performed with a DeltaVision OMX V4 microscope equipped with a x100/1.4 numerical aperture (NA) Plan Super Apochromat oil immersion objective (Olympus) and electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (Evolve 512B; Photometrics) camera for a pixel size of 80 nm. Diode lasers at 405, 488, 561 and 647 nm were used with the standard corresponding emission filters. Z-stacks were acquired by scanning the sample in the axial direction (z-step of 125 nm) using 5 phases and 3 angles per image plane. Raw images were reconstructed using SoftWorx v.6.5 (GE Healthcare Systems) using channel-specific optical transfer functions (pixel size of reconstructed images = 40 nm). The quality of reconstructed images was assessed using the SIMcheck plugin (doi: 10.1038/srep15915) of ImageJ v.1.52i.	Multiple channel images were aligned using Chromagnon (doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-25922-7). Images were smoothed using 3D Gaussian filters (σ = 0.5), and FISH probes were segmented in 3D using Otsu’s method. Segmented objects smaller than 0.04 μm3 or in contact to the image border were discarded. Images with more than one segmented object per channel were discarded. For CND quantification, the watershed function was applied to the complement of the scaled intensity values (0 to 1, without Gaussian filter) within ROIs defined by the full probe segmentations described above. Watershed segmented objects smaller than 0.0072 μm3 were discarded.

These data were compared to the ESC conditions from Experiment Mouse_ESC_TADs. NPC from cryo-section of mouse brain neocortex of  E14.5 C57BL/6J embryos (ncxNPC) were subjected to the DNA FISH procedure as in Experiment Mouse_ESC_TADs. Two pairs of TAD probes were observed and were monitored by pair to compare their degree of intermingling (Overlap Fractions (OFs) and 3D distances with consecutive Oligopaint probes between adjacent TADs, see the article) with ESCs from Experiment Mouse_ESC_TADs and this experiment. Slides with hybridized cells were observed with 3D-SIM.

Quality Control Description	Mouse NPCs were obtained from differentiation of ESCs described in Experiment Mouse_ESC_TADs. The presence of the Pax6 NPC marker was verified by RTqPCR and immuno-labeling using an anti-Pax6 (catalog no. PRB-278P-0100; Covance). In the tissue sections (ncxNPC), NPC were localized according to their position in the brain neocortex, i.e. in the ventricular zone containing apical progenitors (Pax6 positive NPC) (Bonev et al., doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2017.09.043). All mice were housed and maintained according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM) in accordance with the European Council directive 2010/63/UE for the protection and use of vertebrate animals.

Protocol Description	In the NPC dataset, mouse ESCs described in Experiment Mouse_ESC_TADs were differentiated into NPCs as described by Gaspard et al. (doi: 10.1038/nprot.2009.157) with the following changes. Cells were plated (2.5 x 10e5 cells per 10-cm dish) on 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes in the ESC medium described in Experiment Mouse_ESC_TADs. After 1 day, cells were cultured in DDM medium (DMEM/F-12, GlutaMAX supplement; catalog no. 31331028; Gibco), supplemented with 0.05% bovine albumin fraction (catalog no. 15260037; Gibco), 1x MEM non-essential amino acids, 50 U penicillin-streptomycin, 1x N-2 supplement (catalog no. 17502048; Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. From day 2 to day 10, medium was changed every 2 days and cyclopamine V. californicum (catalog no. 239803; Merck Millipore) was added to the medium (final concentration of 0.4ug/ml). After 12 days of differentiation, cells were dissociated with StemPro Accutase (catalog no. A1110501; Gibco), plated on 6-well plates (containing an autoclaved glass coverslip (170 ± 5 μm (ZEISS)) coated with poly-L-lysine (catalog no. P2636; Sigma-Aldrich)/laminin (catalog no. 11243217001; Sigma-Aldrich) and cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DDM and neurobasal medium (catalog no. 21103049; Gibco) supplemented with 1X B-27 supplement minus vitamin A (catalog no. 12587010; Gibco) and 1x GlutaMAX supplement and 50 U penicillin-streptomycin for an additional 2 days (day 12 + 2) to obtain NPCs. Coverslips containing NPCs were then washed once with PBS before fixation prior to the FISH procedure. For the ncxNPC dataset, Mouse brains from E14.5 C57BL/6J embryos were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C. They were then cryopreserved for 24 h at 4°C in a PBS-20% sucrose solution. After embedding in optimal cutting temperature compound and rapid freezing in isopentane, brains were sectioned at 10-um width on glass slides with a cryostat (Leica Biosystems). Slides containing fixed mouse brain neocortex were then submitted to the FISH procedure.	For NPC differentiation conditions and ncxNPC preparation (see details of the protocol on the left column).	Cells were hybridized with the Oligopaint fluorescent probes using a DNA FISH protocol, which is briefly described in the article and a detailed protocol can be found in Szabo et al.

Quality Control Description	mESC E14 CTCF-GFP-Tir1-TIGRE (referred to as CTCF-AID) was originally described in Saldana-Meyer et al. (doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2019.08.015). The parental mESC E14 used to generate mESC E14 CTCF-GFP-Tir1-TIGRE line was initially authenticated in the laboratory of Benoit Bruneau by karyotyping and genotyping with primers that detected homozygous SNPs of 129 strains, but was not re-authenticated for this study. The CTCF degradation (after AUX treatment) was verified by Western-Blot using an anti-CTCF antibody (catalog no. 61311; Active motif) and an anti-Vinculin (catalog no. sc-73614; SantaCruz) as loading control.

Protocol Description	Mouse CTCF-AID ES cells (ID no. EN204.3; doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2019.08.015) were cultured in the same condition as in Experiment Mouse_ESC_TADs. The induction of CTCF degradation by the Auxin-inducible degron (AID) system (referred to as AUX) was performed as described in Nora et al. (doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.004). Two days before the FISH, approximately 150.000 cells were plated in a 6-well plate containing an autoclaved glass coverslip (170 ± 5 μm (ZEISS)) coated with 0.1% gelatin, with medium containing indole-3-acetic acid sodium salt (final concentration at 500 µM) (auxin analog; catalog no. 16954; Cayman Chemical), and fresh medium-containing Auxin replacement after one day. Mouse ESCs were grown on the coverslip for a total of 2 days in the presence of Auxin and washed once with PBS before fixation prior to the FISH procedure.	No specific treatment or Auxin treatment for 2 days for CTCF degradation (see details on the left column).	Cells were hybridized with the Oligopaint fluorescent probes using a DNA FISH protocol, which is briefly described in the article and a detailed protocol can be found in Szabo et al. (PMID: 32820407; DOI: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0664-3_13). Here, pairs of Oligopaint probes labeled with ATTO 565 and ATTO 647 fluorophores were used for OFs  and 3D distance measurements, only Oligopaint probes labeled with ATTO 565 were used to count the number of  CNDs inside TADs. The number of oligos per Oligopaint probe depends on its genomic size and the density of oligos found in that region. The coordinates, the size and the number of oligos for each Oligopaint probe can be found in the Extended Data Fig.9 of the article. Each oligo carryies 3 fluorophores allowing a robust fluorescent signal of each Oligopaint probe. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Coverslips containing cells were mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD and sealed with nail polish. 3D-SIM imaging was performed with a DeltaVision OMX V4 microscope equipped with a x100/1.4 numerical aperture (NA) Plan Super Apochromat oil immersion objective (Olympus) and electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (Evolve 512B; Photometrics) camera for a pixel size of 80 nm. Diode lasers at 405, 488, 561 and 647 nm were used with the standard corresponding emission filters. Z-stacks were acquired by scanning the sample in the axial direction (z-step of 125 nm) using 5 phases and 3 angles per image plane. Raw images were reconstructed using SoftWorx v.6.5 (GE Healthcare Systems) using channel-specific optical transfer functions (pixel size of reconstructed images = 40 nm). The quality of reconstructed images was assessed using the SIMcheck plugin (doi: 10.1038/srep15915) of ImageJ v.1.52i.	Multiple channel images were aligned using Chromagnon (doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-25922-7). Images were smoothed using 3D Gaussian filters (σ = 0.5), and FISH probes were segmented in 3D using Otsu’s method. Segmented objects smaller than 0.04 μm3 or in contact to the image border were discarded. Images with more than one segmented object per channel were discarded. For CND quantification, the watershed function was applied to the complement of the scaled intensity values (0 to 1, without Gaussian filter) within ROIs defined by the full probe segmentations described above. Watershed segmented objects smaller than 0.0072 μm3 were discarded.

Protocol Description	Flies (Drosophila melanogaster) were raised in standard cornmeal yeast extract medium at 21°C. Embryos were collected on agar/vinegar plates at stages 15-16 after egg laying, equivalent to a development of 12-16 h at 25°C. Embryos were manually dechorionated on a double-sided adhesive tape and displayed on an agar/vinegar plate to avoid drying during manual selection under a GFP binocular. A Y-GFP reporter line was used to select WT GFP+ male embryos (Szabo et al., doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aar8082).	4-5 selected dechorionated male embryos were disposed in the center of a glass coverslip (170 ± 5 μm (ZEISS)) coated with 1:10 poly-L-lysine (catalog no. P8920; Sigma-Aldrich) and squeezed directly on the coverslip with a Dumont #55 tweezer to produce a monolayer of cells.

Protocol Description	Flies (Drosophila melanogaster) were raised and embryos were processed as described in Experiment Drosophila_DAPI. To analyze the 110 kb Drosophila TAD in an haploid context, that is, on chromosome X in male embryos, a Y-GFP reporter line (see genotype above) was used to select WT GFP+ male embryos (Szabo et al., doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aar8082). For the sake of homogeneity and simplicity, the same Drosophila line was used in Experiment Drosophila_DAPI.	4-5 selected dechorionated male embryos were disposed in the center of a glass coverslip (170 ± 5 μm (ZEISS)) coated with 1:10 poly-L-lysine (catalog no.

Cells were hybridized with the Oligopaint fluorescent probe using a DNA FISH protocol, which is briefly described in the article and a detailed protocol can be found in Szabo et al. (PMID: 32820407; DOI: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0664-3_13). Here, the Oligopaint probe was labeled with ATTO 565 fluorophore. The coordinates, the size and the number of oligos for the Drosophila TAD probe can be found in the Extended Data Fig.9 of the article. Each oligo of the probe carries 3 fluorophores. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Coverslips containing cells were mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD and sealed with nail polish. 3D-SIM imaging was performed with a DeltaVision OMX V4 microscope equipped with a x100/1.4 numerical aperture (NA) Plan Super Apochromat oil immersion objective (Olympus) and electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (Evolve 512B; Photometrics) camera for a pixel size of 80 nm. Diode lasers at 405, 488, 561 and 647 nm were used with the standard corresponding emission filters. Z-stacks were acquired by scanning the sample in the axial direction (z-step of 125 nm) using 5 phases and 3 angles per image plane. Raw images were reconstructed using SoftWorx v.6.5 (GE Healthcare Systems) using channel-specific optical transfer functions (pixel size of reconstructed images = 40 nm). The quality of reconstructed images was assessed using the SIMcheck plugin (doi: 10.1038/srep15915) of ImageJ v.1.52i.	For comparison with DAPI  (Experiment F), a single z-slice was randomly selected between the minimum and maximum z coordinate of the FISH-segmented object. Watershed was then applied as for DAPI, within ROIs defined by the probe segmentation.
